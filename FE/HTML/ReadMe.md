"Hey, today, I completed brushing up on and improving my skills in HTML.
<br>I've uploaded two projects: the first one was a practice project I created while following a course, and the second is a task designed to test skills and gain hands-on experience, which is a great way to learn and build proficiency.
<br>Here's the YouTube link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUMe1FH4CHE&t=9047s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org">YT</a>
<br>And here's the GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/gitdagray/html_course/tree/main"> GitHub</a>
<br>Most of the concepts were covered in these projects, so feel free to check them out and give it a try!"
